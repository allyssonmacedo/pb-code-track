# Analyze Your Runkeeper Fitness Data
> With the explosion in fitness tracker popularity, runners all of the world are collecting data with gadgets (smartphones, watches, etc.) to keep themselves motivated. They look for answers to questions like:

How fast, long, and intense was my run today?
Have I succeeded with my training goals?
Am I progressing?
What were my best achievements?
How do I perform compared to others?

I exported seven years worth of my training data from Runkeeper. The data is a CSV file where each row is a single training activity. In this project, you'll create import, clean, and analyze my data to answer the above questions. You can then apply the same strategy to your training data if you wish!
