# Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
> Manipulating and visualizing movie and TV data

In this project, we’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

You’ll also gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. This will allow you to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data. Press play to begin!
